# goticketless!

Goticketless is an application that helps tourists visit monuments around the country without having to stand in long queues buying tickets. The application seamlessly
reduces the task of issuing tickets where the caretakers of the museums can spend more time and effort into taking care of the monument rather than issue tickets at 
the counters for long queues. It is useful during pandemic times like the Covid where human interaction should be reduced and social distancing increased. These are 
the times that are critical for the country since tourism is affected the most and the revenue has to be managed in the field of tourism. In addition, it saves lot of 
time, paperwork and human effort. Efficient time management is possible where the tourists can fix slots of when they want to visit and book accordingly. 

The GUI is very interactive and easy to use. After selecting the place, a short description about the same is provided to the user to increase their attention. The 
address is included below and ratings is displayed for the user to decide booking. He can then book tickets. During booking the ticket, details like the number of 
visitors, adult or child, time slot and date is filled. It is based on a QR based ticketing system with necessary hardware for the seamless visitor experience in 
museums or heritage sites. Once the user enters all the above details and submits, he gets an uniquely generated QR code. This code contains the details entered 
encoded inside it. The generated QR code can be screenshotted and later used at the entry and scanned. 

There are few advancements that can be done in the future that includes payment options, make a small prediction on the crowd to understand the interest of the people 
and predict the revenue through statistics. Travel and stay can be integrated with this application to make it easier for the tourists, augmented and virtual reality 
can be implemented, for example, live streaming of monuments since not everyone visit places physically and spectate things that is unique to that monument.
